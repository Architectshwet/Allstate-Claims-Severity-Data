# Allstate-Claims-Severity-Data




When you’ve been devastated by a serious car accident, your focus is on the things that matter the most: family, friends, and other loved ones. Pushing paper with your insurance agent is the last place you want your time or mental energy spent. This is why Allstate, a personal insurer in the United States, is continually seeking fresh ideas to improve their claims service for the over 16 million households they protect.



Allstate is currently developing automated methods of predicting the cost, and hence severity, of claims. In this recruitment challenge, Kagglers are invited to show off their creativity and flex their technical chops by creating an algorithm which accurately predicts claims severity. Aspiring competitors will demonstrate insight into better ways to predict claims severity for the chance to be part of Allstate’s efforts to ensure a worry-free customer experience.

Procedure: To create an algorithm which accurately predicts claims severity.
Heatmaps, boxplots,  distribution plots and the correlation between the continuous and categorical variables were applied as part of Exploratory Data Analysis.
 All the features are already normalized but target variable is highly skewed so log transformation was applied.
Feature Engineering, i.e one hot encoding over some categorical variables and keras deep learning model was applied to the data.
